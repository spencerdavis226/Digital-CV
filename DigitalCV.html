          <h3>Power Patch: Self-Heating Patch for Transdermal Drug Delivery</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Collaborated with a team of 4 engineers to design and develop a
                self-heating transdermal patch that enhances drug delivery
                through the skin. The patch utilizes sodium acetate tri-hydrate
                for heat generation, which increases the diffusion rate of
                water-soluble drugs into the bloodstream.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Engineered a phase-changing insulating layer made from
                lauric-capric acid, which controls the rate of temperature
                increase to ensure the safe delivery of drugs.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Developed a hollow nickel micro-needle array to bypass epidermal
                resistance and facilitate effective drug delivery directly to
                the bloodstream.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Incorporated a silver nanoparticle-laced adhesive layer to
                maintain skin contact and prevent bacterial infections,
                enhancing the safety and efficacy of the patch.
